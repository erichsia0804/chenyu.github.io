            <h2>More about my interests</h2>
            <p>After getting some background information about myself, we can now talk about lighter topics. Basketball is my favorite sport, and I have played it. Stephen Curry is my go-to GOAT for the sport. Being the man who changed the basketball culture influenced my playing style- making the three-point line my go-to attack decision. On the other hand, the sport that I like to watch but not participate in will be watching Formula 1. The revving sound is like a melody in my ear! The driver I love the most is Louis Hamilton; their driving skill and influence outside the sport have shown how he is an influencer and celebrity. Due to my passion for cars, I love to head out on the freeway to take a short trip without knowing the destination just for a quick rev and speed. The moment when I am behind the wheel, my blood flows so fast that I will be so focused and hyped. 

                I also enjoy understanding watch models and market value in my spare time. Watches are like knowledge and market understanding for me. I like to analyze my mind and decide which models are suitable to investigate with a high return. Even if I do not buy them, I can track the price and market value for fun and further understanding.
